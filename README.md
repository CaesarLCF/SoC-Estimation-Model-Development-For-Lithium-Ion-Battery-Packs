# SoC-Estimation-Model-Development-For-Lithium-Ion-Battery-Packs
1) This project aims to develop a State of Charge (SoC) estimation model for lithium-ion battery pack systems using both conventional methods, such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and data-driven approaches, including backpropagation neural network (BPNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU). 

2) The internal parameter datasets of Li-FP, Li-NMC, Li-NCA, Li-PO, and Li-Ion Graphite Batteries under various operating conditions will be collected. The collected internal parameter datasets including Terminal Voltage, Open-Circuit Voltage, Load Current, and Cell Temperature. Meanwhile, the SoC datasets will be pre-processed through the Coulomb Counting Method.

3) The research will provide a detailed comparison of these SoC estimation methods based on the performance metrics of coefficient of determination (R²), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE) and development factors of developing time and number of parameters/hyperparameters to determine the necessity for implementing data-driven models and the best-performing data-driven model for lithium-ion battery pack systems in the AMR sector.
