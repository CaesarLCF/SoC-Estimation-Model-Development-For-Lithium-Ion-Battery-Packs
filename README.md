# SoC-Estimation-Model-Development-For-Lithium-Ion-Battery-Packs
This project aims to develop a state estimation model for LIB and LiBat systems using both conventional methods, such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and data-driven approaches, including backpropagation neural network (BPNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU). The research will provide a detailed comparison of these SoC estimation methods based on coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE), determining the necessity for implementing data-driven models and the best-performing data-driven model for LIB and LiBat systems in the AMR sector. To achieve this, the following objectives must be completed:
