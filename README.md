# SoC-Estimation-Model-Development-For-Lithium-Ion-Battery-Packs
• Develop a state estimation model for lithium-ion battery pack systems using both conventional methods, such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and data-driven approaches, including backpropagation neural network (BPNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU). 

• Provide a detailed comparison of these State of Charge (SoC) estimation methods based on coefficient of determination (R²), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE), determining the necessity for implementing data-driven models and the best-performing data-driven model.
